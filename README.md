# KLL FindIt AI

lost-and-found matching system for classrooms and labs at Kolehiyo ng Lungsod ng Lipa (KLL). Made for **CSE 103 Intelligent System**.

Someone reports a lost item, staff log a found item, and the system suggests the most likely matches with a score and the reasons. Staff always verify the owner before an item is released.

## Quick start (Windows)

You need **Python 3.13** (tick "Add python.exe to PATH" when installing) and **Git**. Don't have them? See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

Open Command Prompt and run these one at a time:

```
mkdir C:\dev
cd C:\dev
git clone https://github.com/Ceihiro/findit-ai.git
cd findit-ai
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed_data.py
python app.py
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your browser. Press **Ctrl + C** in the terminal to stop.

Every time you come back: `cd C:\dev\findit-ai`, `venv\Scripts\activate`, `git pull`, `python app.py`.

## How it works

Each found item gets two scores, mixed 50/50:

- **Attribute score (rules):** category, color, brand, location, and time.
- **Text score (AI):** TF-IDF and cosine similarity on the descriptions, using scikit-learn.

The top 3 matches are shown with the reasons. The weights are in `config.py`.
